#FizzBuzz
***
The FizzBuzz problem is often a feature of coding interviews. We will work on the simplest version.

##The problem
***
For a given list of integers, print the list of numbers. If a number is a multiple of three, print the word 'Fizz' instead of that number. If a number is a multiple of 5, print the word 'Buzz' instead of that number. If a number is a multiple of both three and five, print 'FizzBuzz' instead of that number.

###A twist
***
In addtion to the requirements above, if a number contains a three and is not a multiple of three, print 'Fizz' instead of that number. If a number contains a five but is not a multiple of five, print 'Buzz' instead of that number. If a number contains both a five and a three and is not a multiple of both, print 'FizzBuzz' instead of that number.
